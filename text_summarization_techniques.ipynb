Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

Here, I also witnessed the \\nparticipation of acting Chief Justice of Jammu & Kashmir along with State Government \\nauthorities in on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to be provide d to the victims whose \\nhouses had been damaged in the earth quake. I have experienced many s uch acts of \\ncourage from our citizens when faced with severe challenges. \\n \\nCourage in combating calamities \\nIn 2005, I met the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, Children of Chuckchucha village \\nduring my visit to Car Nicobar Islands. While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands. Touched by their courage, I composed few vers es called “Sea \\nWaves” which reads as follows: \\nSea Waves \\n \\nWe are the children of Sea waves, \\nSea waves are my friends. \\nWhen they become angry, \\nSea waves give the challenges. \\nGod has given the courage, \\nTo challenge the sea waves. \\nAnd we will succeed, \\nWe will succeed \\nWith Almighty’s grace. \\nAll the members who were gathered in the village sang the poem with me and exhibited \\nlots of courage and enthusiasm even though they had gone through severe  suffering \\nduring the Tsunami. \\n \\nConnectivity for societal transformation \\nI addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South \\nAfrica. This was attended by 53 member countries of the Africa n Union, where I \\nproposed the concept of Pan African e-Network for providing seamless and integrated \\nsatellite, fiber optics and wireless network connecting 53 African countries at an \\nestimated cost of US $ 100 million. \\n \\nAs part of the project 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 Super \\nSpecialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), 53 tele-me dicine centers and 53 \\ntele-education centres in Africa will be connected. The pilot project on tele-education and \\ntele-medicine in Ethiopia has already been commissioned.

I am extremely happy that Indian experience  in bringing the \\nbenefits of technology to the people has enabled us to work with Afric a to bring societal \\ntransformation in the African continent. \\n \\nDefending the nation: Our pride \\nI visited KUMAR in Siachen Glacier located at 17,000 feet altitude held by the Indian \\nArmy, had a memorable underwater journey in INS Sindhurakshak and flew  in a Sukhoi-\\n30 fighter experiencing 2.5 g. In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state police personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting into practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration. Particularly, I \\nhappened to know the transformation which has taken place among the students  of \\nMedak district. As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is encouraging the youth of India to strive for a developed India by 2020. They have met with over 15 lakh youth who share the same aspiration to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages, citing a positive experience in Nagaland where a village council was functioning effectively with financial powers. They suggest that if all 600,000 villages in India are empowered and well-connected, it could lead to significant transformation. The speaker also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, called PURA, which aims to provide urban amenities in rural areas, including physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic connectivity and employment generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project called PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) in Periyar villages, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, enabling villagers to grow Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, and generate power using bio-mass. Additionally, the villagers have set up food processing and marketing centers. The project has also enabled the villagers to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products with the support of JETRO specialists and feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo. The speaker believes that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 PURA projects required to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two personal experiences that have inspired them. The first experience is meeting over 6,000 farmers from different parts of the country at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where they showed great interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is meeting a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands or legs. Despite his physical limitations, he had a radiant smile and a positive attitude. When asked what he needed, he replied that he didn't need anything from the speaker, but instead wanted to sing in front of him. The speaker is inspired by Vidwan's confidence, training, and help from others, and is reminded that defeat is not the end, and that one can still succeed despite challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two stories of resilience and overcoming challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first story is about a person with a physical disability who has a latent talent for music. Despite his limitations, he is encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others, and is able to blossom as a musician. He wants to use his talent to inspire others and has even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people and children of Jammu & Kashmir who were affected by the 2005 earthquake. The speaker visited Urusa village, which was adopted by the Western Air Command, Air Force, and saw firsthand the devastation and loss caused by the earthquake. However, despite the challenges, the villagers were able to overcome their problems and become the \"masters of their problems\" rather than letting the problems become their \"masters\". The speaker praises the courage and resilience of the people of Urusa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of perseverance, positivity, and partnership in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes the author's experiences during times of crisis and calamity. The author mentions participating in a relief operation with the Armed Forces and seeing children and villagers bravely helping out. The author also mentions a visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met with Tribal Council Leaders and saw the resilience of the islanders who had lost loved ones in the 2004 Tsunami. The author was moved by their courage and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to commemorate their bravery. The author also mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2004, where they spoke about the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a project called the Pan African e-Network, which aims to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optic, and wireless network at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project includes connecting 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa. A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, which includes a tele-education program for Ethiopian students and a tele-medicine program that allows specialists from India to provide medical care remotely.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens.\n",

They share a positive example from Medak district, where students have shown improvements in self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and reduced stage fear. The speaker also shares a personal story of a student who was inspired by the Lead India training to help her father quit smoking. The speaker believes that the 540 million youth in India under the age of 25 are a powerful resource and can be empowered through value-based education and leadership. The speech concludes by highlighting the diversity and richness of Indian culture and tradition, and the efforts being made by various agencies to empower the youth.\n",

      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization, which is a responsibility for future generations.
